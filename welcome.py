NeqSim is a library for calculation of fluid behavior, phase equilibrium and process simulation. This this project is a collectiomn of Streamlit models using neqsim for simulation.The method documentation for the models found in this application can be found in [Introduction to Gas Processing using NeqSim in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EvenSol/NeqSim-Colab/blob/master/notebooks/examples_of_NeqSim_in_Colab.ipynb).

## NeqSim project in GitHub
The NeqSim library is written in the Java programming language. The source code and libraries are hosted in GitHub.
